# FlyCorp Calculations & Logistical Problem Solving

In the game [FlyCorp](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1372530/Fly_Corp/) you develop your air transport network in different cities and countries: build routes, launch new planes, improve planes and airports.

To build the most efficient transportation system, I decided to introduce mathematical weights for the value (importance) of a particular airport's connections to all other airports. 

The weight (importance) of the connection is defined as the ratio of the number of residents of an airport city to the distance to the selected airport.

Therefore, I wrote a program for myself with a console interface, which will: 
- Receive and record data; 
- Process and store data in a csv file; 
- Make all the necessary calculations;
- Give a ready solution for a particular airport.

## Next steps
- Analyze the needs of the residents of each city;
- Compile statistics on destination airports on the routes;
- Consider the transport system as a whole, as a system of mathematical graph;
- Build routes that are effective for the system as a whole.
